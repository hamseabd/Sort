# Sorting Linear Linked List
Project is  done in CSCI 1913 in University of Minnesota. this algorithm efficiently sorts linear linked list
this program sorts fast,  slicing two parts in to the list, sorting them each, using testing, halving, sorting and combining method.
testing phase works in O(1)
halving phase takes O(n) where n is the length of the unsorted list. adding node left or write only takes O(1)
combining phase works in O(n)
SortNode Method works in O(1)
